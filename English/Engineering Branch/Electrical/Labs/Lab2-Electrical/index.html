                        In this laboratory, students will get to explore and
                        learn various concepts regarding analog electrical
                        signals, networks and measurement of various electrical
                        components. The experiments are developed on open source
                        web-based platforms, so that the student doesn't need to
                        download or install any third-party application. Each
                        experiment is designed in such a way that, the student
                        first gets to learn the theories well and then perform
                        the experiment to enhance their knowledge.
